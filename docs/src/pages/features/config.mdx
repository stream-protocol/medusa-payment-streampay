# StreamPay Plugin Installation on Medusa Commerce

Medusa Commerce is a flexible and modular open-source e-commerce platform, and integrating the Stream Payment Gateway with it can supercharge your store with the power of decentralized payments. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you seamlessly integrate the Stream Payment Gateway with Medusa Commerce.

## Prerequisites:

1. **Medusa Commerce Setup**: Ensure you have a running instance of Medusa Commerce.
2. **StreamPaymentsâ„¢ Account**: Sign up and get your Stream Payment Gateway API keys from the StreamPayments platform.
3. **Node.js & npm**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.

## Installation Steps:

### 1. Install the StreamPay Plugin:

Using npm, install the Stream Payment Gateway plugin for Medusa:

```bash
npm install @stream-payments/medusa-plugin-streampay
```

### 2. Configure Medusa:

Open your Medusa configuration file (`medusa-config.js`) and add the Stream Payment Gateway plugin:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins
    {
      resolve: "@stream-payments/medusa-plugin-streampay",
      options: {
        apiKey: "YOUR_STREAM_PAYMENTS_API_KEY",
        // other configuration options
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

Replace `YOUR_STREAM_PAYMENTS_API_KEY` with the API key you obtained from the Stream Payment Gateway platform.

### 3. Initialize the Plugin:

In your Medusa server initialization script, import and initialize the StreamPay (Stream Payment Gateway) plugin:

```javascript
const StreamPayProvider = require("@stream-payments/medusa-plugin");

// ... other imports and initialization code

Medusa.boot({
  // ... other boot options
  paymentProviders: [
    // ... other payment providers
    new StreamPayProvider({
      apiKey: "YOUR_STREAM_PAYMENTS_API_KEY",
      // other initialization options
    }),
  ],
});
```

### 4. Test the Integration:

Before deploying to a production environment, ensure you test the integration:

1. Create a test product on your Medusa store.
2. Attempt to purchase the product using the Stream Payment Gateway.
3. Verify that the payment goes through and that the funds are correctly transferred.
